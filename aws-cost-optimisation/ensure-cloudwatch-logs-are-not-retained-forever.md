# Ensure Cloudwatch logs are not retained forever

Cloudwatch log groups can be configured to automatically delete logs based on a retention setting. However the default AWS retention setting for cloudwatch log groups is set to "Never Expire" log events. This typically leads to cloudwatch logging costs increasing day by day as more log events are added to Cloudwatch. Cloudwatch log storage is roughly $0.03 per GB per month (at time of writing) so is inexpensive and typically not seen as problematic to begin with. However over time costs of log storage can become a problem if a large amount of logging is generated by your AWS workloads, stored in Cloudwatch logs and then retained forever. 

### Therefore

To avoid cloudwatch log storage costs continually increasing over time ensure that *all* cloudwatch log groups have specified a retention setting that isn't "Never Expire". The retention setting can be set at various durations from 1 day to 10 years. Once a sensible retention setting is specified, log events older than the retention setting will be automatically deleted and related storage costs will not be incurred.

## Identifying log groups with "Never Expire" retention

The "Never Expire" retention setting is represented as a missing retentionInDays property in the AWS Cloudwatch Logs API response for [DescribeLogGroups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeLogGroups.html). The following [aws logs describe-log-groups AWS CLI command](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/logs/describe-log-groups.html) filters using a [JMESPath expression](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-output.html#cli-usage-output-filter) for log groups without a retention setting (in the eu-west-1 region within a single AWS account). Note the double negative with ! (not) applied to not_null(retentionInDays).    

```aws logs describe-log-groups --query 'logGroups[?!not_null(retentionInDays)].logGroupName' --region eu-west-1```

## Specifying log group retention

### Specifying log group retention in the AWS Console

The log group retention setting can be set after a log group has been created in the AWS Console. See the AWS documentation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/Working-with-log-groups-and-streams.html#SettingLogRetention.

Note, you cannot specify log group retention when creating a log group within the AWS console. 

### Specifying log group retention using Cloudformation or Terraform

Both cloudformation and terraform support creation of cloudwatch log groups with a retention in days property in each case.
* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-logs-loggroup.html
* https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/cloudwatch_log_group

### Bulk update existing log groups with "Never Expire" retention

A sample python3 script that iterates through all cloudwatch log groups in all regions in a single AWS account and sets the retention period to 7 days where not already set. 
```python3
import boto3


def main():
    retention_in_days = 7

    for region_name in all_regions():
        set_retention_period_for_never_expiring_log_groups(region_name, retention_in_days)


def all_regions():
    response = boto3_client("ec2").describe_regions()
    return [region["RegionName"] for region in response["Regions"]]


def set_retention_period_for_never_expiring_log_groups(region_name, retention_in_days):
    print("Processing log groups in region '{}' ...".format(region_name))

    logs_client = boto3_client("logs", region_name=region_name)

    for log_group in all_log_groups(logs_client):
        if "retentionInDays" not in log_group:
            update_log_group_retention_setting(logs_client, log_group["logGroupName"], retention_in_days)

    print("Processed all log groups in region '{}'.".format(region_name))


def all_log_groups(logs_client):
    all_log_groups = []
    paginator = logs_client.get_paginator("describe_log_groups")

    for page in paginator.paginate():
        all_log_groups.extend(page["logGroups"])

    return all_log_groups


def update_log_group_retention_setting(logs_client, log_group_name, retention_in_days):
    logs_client.put_retention_policy(logGroupName=log_group_name, retentionInDays=retention_in_days)
    print(" - Updated retention setting for log group '{}' to {} days.".format(log_group_name, retention_in_days))


def boto3_client(service, region_name=None):
    if region_name:
        return boto3.client(service, region_name=region_name)
    else:
        return boto3.client(service)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```
